# A stash of twitter bots written mostly in bash

This is a repo for a range of bots, some of which are copies or rewrites of 
my daily bot project BotADayBotAway. The intention here is to port any currently
running bots to as much bash as I can and to remove the reliance on t/sferik 
which requires ruby.
